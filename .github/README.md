# OpenFGA (Unofficial) – with AuthZEN Authorization API 1.0

> ⚠️ **Unofficial build** — This is not an official OpenFGA release.

This project is based on OpenFGA v1.9.2 and includes an AuthZEN Authorization API 1.0 implementation ported from the upstream [`poc/authzen-1`](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/tree/poc/authzen-1) branch. It is distributed under the Apache License 2.0.

### Key points

- Adds AuthZEN 1.0 endpoints alongside standard OpenFGA APIs.  
- Ported from upstream `poc/authzen-1` branch with minimal changes to core logic.  
- Core OpenFGA behavior from v1.9.2 remains intact.  
- Experimental: Interfaces may change; no security audit performed.
